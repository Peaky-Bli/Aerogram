Append Function//Concatenate the Character
    Write the char C in the right position
    IF end of array
        then Write from Beginning

SerialWrite Function- Take the char and write String on terminal
    FOR all the the character length
    Append/Concatenate the Character
    ENDFOR
Interrupt Subroutine-
    IF Read position not equal to Write position
    Then Write in UDR reg 
    Increment position
    ENDIF
    IF SerialReadPosition greater than Buffer size
    then increment the SerialReadPosition
END Interrupt
